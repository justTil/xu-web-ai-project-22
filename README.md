# AnnieAI.ML

[ANNIE.ML](https://www.annieai.ml/) is a website that offers you a fun way to experience artificial intelligence,
by enabling you to run your own AI projects directly in the web browser.

## What is AnnieAI.ML?
AnnieAI is a web-based AI project using TensorFlow by Google, which allows you to create 
your own AI playgrounds. The idea behind the project is to ease entry into the  AI world for everyone by letting you create your own small AI 
applications.
## Who Is Annie?
Annie is your personal artificial friend that is excited to learn new things. 
With our playground, you can teach Annie about objects in your room or bring your friends and let them meet Annie.


## What Is the Playground?
Using the playground, you can add pictures with your webcam and train the AI in your 
web browser. By creating new classes, you can, e.g., add new objects you have lying
around in your room. For example, an Apple and an ML learning Book.

### How Does the Playground Work?
For visualization, let's take the Apple and the ML Learning Book.
The default amount of classes we have is two 
however it is up to you how many classes
you want to create. For our example, we will work with the two classes already 
created. 

Let's start with the Apple. Our website uses the webcam to take pictures of the
objects you want to add, so please allow the website access. Now that your webcam
picture appears, you can take the apple and hold it into the frame. Start taking
pictures by pressing and holding the "Take Picture" button. You will see the number
of images you've taken on the right. When you shake your hand, or some pictures 
are lower quality, don't be mad because that helps Annie to detect
complex or lower quality pictures of your object in the future. Let's say that you took 100 
photos of the apple, you may now change the object. Our second object is the ML
Learning Book. Position it inside the webcam frame and hold the "Take Picture." button from the second class. For accuracy reasons, please make sure that you take
roughly the same amount of pictures for every item. In our case, we should have around
One hundred photos of each object. 

Now let's test the AI. Take the item of your choice, and Annie now tells you how sure 
she is about what item she believes you are showing. By adding more evenly distributed pictures, 
the accuracy becomes better.
